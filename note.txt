USING JEST FOR UNIT TESTING
------------------------------------------------------------

- create a node project using npm init --yes
- Install jest using npm install jest --save-dev
- replace the value of the test key in package.json to jest
- create a file called function.js(any name) ... this is where you will have all functions you want to test
- create a file called function.test.js(anyname.test.js) ...this is where you will write your test


TO CHECK FRO TRUTHY AND FALSY VALUES
---------------------------------------------------
- toBeNull matches only null 
- toBeUndefined matches only undefined
- toBeDefined is the opposite of toBeUndefined
- toBeTruthy matches anything that an if statement treats as true
- toBeFalsy matches anything that an if statement treats as false


note: 
- Test Suites means the number of test files we have
- If you want the test to be running automatically as you are developing(typing), add "testwatch" (anyname) key the 
to the scripts object in the package.json and give it a value of "jest --watchAll" i.e "testwatch": "jest --watchAll".
then use "npm run testwatch" to run the test instead of "npm test"
